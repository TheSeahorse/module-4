/**
 * 
 * Q: Explain the concept of rendezvous.
 * Rendevous is a "meeting point", here we want two threads to have a meeting point after each iteration
 * 
 * Q: What will happen when you wait on a semaphore?
 * It will check that it's > 0, if not it will wait for it to be, otherwise it will decrement it
 * 
 * Q: What will happen when you signal on a semaphore?
 * It increments the semaphore
 * 
 * Q: How can semaphores be used to enforce rendezvous between two threds?
 * Well, like above, we create two binary semaphores and each thread have to wait for the semaphore that
 * the other thread can signal to. I.e, if it's >0 the other process have signaled to it and the thread can print
 * for that iteration and then signal its own semaphore
 * 
 * Q: How are mutex locks different compared to semaphores?
 * The semaphore is a signaling mechanism which use wait() and signal() to 
 * indicate whether they are acquring or releasing the resource,
 * while a mutex requires the thread to acquire the lock itself and release it after it's "done" with the shared resource
 * 
 * Q: Why canâ€™t mutex locks be used to solve the rendezvous problem?
 * A mutex lock is meant to be taken and released, 
 * always in that order, by each task that uses the shared resource it protects.
 * 
 * Therefore, we generally don't want to use mutex locks for something like this, 
 * since we want to use a semaphore to signal between tasks
 * I.e. a task either performs wait or signal. Not both.
